Outdated police scanner
Assignment:

1: Update the GUI without changing the functionality of the system!
  This could be stuff like:
    - Add some space (Margin or padding)
    - Add some colors
    - Use CSS to style the application
    - Background images???
    - Anything cool you can think of

2: Update the UX without changing the functionality of the system!!
  This could be stuff like:
    - Auto clear text fields when needed
    - Move focus to text elements when it makes sense
    - Double click?
    - Drag 'n' drop
    - Basically everything that is "GUI programming"
    
3: Add new functionality to the system, but respect UI & UX (Don't make GUI bloopers)
  This could be stuff like:
    - Remove fines
    - Add offender
    - Better offender generation (Maybe use a word list?)
    - whatever you like
